## ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

### Dependencies: Installing FFmpeg

For seamless playback, ensure `ffplay` is installed:

#### Windows:

Download FFmpeg from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system's PATH.

It can also be installed via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/).


#### Linux:

##### For apt-based distros (like Ubuntu and Debian):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

##### For dnf-based distros (like Fedora):

```bash
sudo dnf install ffmpeg
```

##### For pacman-based distros (like Arch):

```bash
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

##### For Gentoo:

```bash
emerge --ask --quiet --verbose media-video/ffmpeg
```

#### macOS:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### FreeBSD:

```bash
pkg install ffmpeg
```

#### NetBSD:

```bash
pkg_add ffmpeg
```

#### OpenBSD:

```bash
doas pkg_add ffmpeg
```

### Terminals for an optimal RadioGoGo experience:

- **Windows:** For a smooth experience on Windows, consider using [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal). It offers multiple tabs, a GPU-accelerated text rendering engine, and a rich set of customization options. If you're fond of UNIX-like environments, [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) combined with Windows Terminal can be a powerful duo.

- **Linux:** On Linux, most modern terminals should work well with BubbleTea. However, [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), a GPU-accelerated terminal, and [Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html), known for its flexibility, stand out as exceptional choices. Both offer great performance and customization options to enhance your TUI experience.

- **macOS:** On macOS, while the default Terminal.app should work fine, you might want to explore [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for its advanced features, superior performance, and extensive customization options. iTerm2's integration with macOS makes it a preferred choice for many developers.

### Installing via Go

Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed (version 1.18 or later).

```bash
go install github.com/Zi0P4tch0/RadioGoGo@latest
```

### Downloading the Binary

Navigate to the `Releases` section of the project repository. 

Find the appropriate binary for your OS, download it, and place it in your system's PATH for easy access.

## üöÄ Usage

Launch RadioGoGo by executing the following command:

```bash
radiogogo
```
